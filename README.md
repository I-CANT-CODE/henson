## Example

See [simulation.c][] and [analysis.cpp][] in [examples/simple](examples/simple) for sample code.

[simulation.c]:     examples/simple/simulation.c
[analysis.cpp]:     examples/simple/analysis.cpp

```
simple.hwl:
sim = ./simulation 1000
ana = ./analysis

world while sim:
    sim
    ana


mpirun -n 4 henson simple.hwl
```

  * [examples/async](examples/async) does the same, but with asynchronous data exchange.

## Motivation

We would like analysis codes to access simulation data, while the
simulation is running, without saving the data to disk. The goal is to let
multiple independent executable share memory (e.g., exchange arrays without
copying their contents) without modifying their memory management systems. We
would also like to control the execution flow, for example, switching between
simulation and analysis after every step of the simulation.

**Shared address space.**
If the executables are built as position-independent code, then their `main`s
can be loaded using the [dynamic loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_loading) facilities `dlopen` and `dlsym`:

```{.cpp}
typedef     int  (*MainType)(int argc, char *argv[]);

void*       lib      = dlopen(fn.c_str(), RTLD_LAZY);
MainType    lib_main = (MainType) dlsym(lib, "main");
```
The `main`s can subsequently be called from a controlling process in the
appropriate order. Since all the executables get loaded into the same address
space, the data can be exchanged between them by simply passing pointers around
â€” no copying or special tricks are required. (Achieving the same zero-copy
between separate processes is much more complicated.)

**Coroutines.**
How can we transfer control between different `main`s?
A simulation may want to stop after every time-step,
transfer control to the analysis code, but then resume where it left off
without losing its state. Similarly, analysis may not be a single executable,
but a chain (or a DAG) of different executables that transfer control to each
other and resume where they left off when the execution returns.

A convenient way to support such a cooperative multitasking regime is via
[coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine).
Executables call `henson_yield()` when they want to relinquish control back to
`henson`. When not running under `henson`, this
routine does nothing and returns immediately.


## Code

### Headers

`henson`'s main interface is in C to make it easy to use from C simulation and
analysis routines. Additionally, it provides some C++ helper functions for
moving data across coroutines.

```{.cpp}
#include <henson/context.h>
#include <henson/data.h>
#include <henson/data.hpp>      // C++ functions
```

### MPI

Since all executables become part of the main `henson` process, MPI must be
initialized and finalized only once. `henson` takes care of the initialization,
so, when running under it, coroutines cannot initialize MPI themselves.
`libhenson`, in the default configuration, includes MPI wrappers (built on
PMPI interface) that are only active when the puppet is running under `henson`.
The wrappers disable initialization and finalization. They also replace
`MPI_COMM_WORLD` by the result of `henson_get_world()`, which returns the MPI
communicator restricted to the puppet's execution group.
See [execution groups][Execution Groups] for more details.

If the wrappers are disabled, the user must avoid initialization/finalization
manually and explicitly request the correct communicator using
`henson_get_world()`.

### Control Transfer

A coroutine can transfer control back to `henson` by calling `henson_yield()`.
`henson` in turn decides where to continue execution next. `henson` cycles
through all coroutines in an [execution group][Execution Groups] in order until
the controlling coroutine specified in the `while`-clause terminates. Once this happens, every
remaining coroutine in the group loop gets called once. A coroutine may check
if its execution group is about to stop (i.e., if a controlling coroutine has
indicated that it's done) by calling `henson_stop()`.

### Data Exchange

Coroutines can exchange data by posting it to a global namespace. Several
helper functions allow exchanging specific types of data:

  * `henson_{save,load}_array(name, address, type, count, stride)`
  * `henson_{save,load}_pointer(name, ptr)`
  * `henson_{save,load}_size_t(name, size)`
  * `henson_{save,load}_int(name, x)`
  * `henson_{save,load}_float(name, x)`
  * `henson_{save,load}_double(name, x)`

In C++, there are additional functions:

  * `henson::save(name, x)`
  * `template<class T> T* henson::load(name)`
  * `henson::exists(name)`

See [include/henson/data.h](include/henson/data.h) and
[include/henson/data.hpp](include/henson/data.hpp)
for more details.

#### Producer

```{.c}
for (/* every timestep */)
{
    // perform some computation

    henson_save_array(...);
    henson_yield();             // return control back to henson
}
```

#### Consumer

Process every time step:
```{.c}
while(1)
{
    henson_load_array(...);

    // process the data
    // if there is any output to pass to other analysis routines downstream,
    // call an appropriate henson_save_...(...)

    henson_yield();             // return control back to henson
}

```

Or process a single snapshot:
```{.c}
float* data;
size_t size;
if (!henson_active())
    // load data from file
else
{
    henson_load_array("data", &data, ...);
    henson_load_size_t("size", &size);
}

// process the data
```
Note that the non-controlling coroutine will be restarted over and over again
as long the controlling coroutine is running. So if the producer generates data
over multiple time-steps, it's fine to supply a consumer that processes only
a single snapshot; it will be restarted automatically. See [HWL][].


### Execution Groups

Different sets of processors may run through different coroutine loops. For
example, the simulation and analysis may run on different processes;
they could switch contexts with additional coroutines that exchange the data
between the groups. The user may specify the different execution groups in the
script supplied to `henson`, specifying the number of processors to dedicate to
each group on the command-line. (If no group sizes are specified, the processes
are split evenly between the groups.)
[examples/intercomm/intercomm.hwl](examples/intercomm/intercomm.hwl) implements
such a pattern. Instead of switching directly to [analysis.cpp][],
[simulation.c][] switches to [send.cpp][], which sends its data over MPI to
[receive.cpp][] on a different set of processes; [receive.cpp][] in turn
switches to [analysis.cpp][].

[send.cpp]:     tools/send.cpp
[receive.cpp]:  tools/receive.cpp

`henson_get_world()` returns the communicator restricted to each execution
group. In the default configuration, it's not necessary to call this function
directly because the MPI wrappers built into `henson` will replace any instance
of `MPI_COMM_WORLD` with the result of this function. To communicate across
groups, [send.cpp][] and [receive.cpp][] use `henson_get_intercomm(group_name)`
to get the appropriate MPI inter-communicator.

Section [HWL][] describes how to specify execution groups in the scripts
supplied to `henson`.

## HWL

The following annotated example
(original in [intercomm.hwl](examples/intercomm/intercomm.hwl))
illustrates the syntax of the scripts supplied to henson.
(A simpler example is [simple.hwl](examples/simple/simple.hwl).)

First, the script specifies the command lines to run and assigns them names.
These commands become the coroutines. Command lines may contain variables (with
defaults in parentheses); the variable values can be supplied to `henson` on
its command line.
```
sim = ../simple/simulation $size(250)
snd = ../../tools/send      consumer t:int data:array
rcv = ../../tools/receive   producer t:int data:array
ana = ../simple/analysis
```

Next, the script specifies two execution groups, `producer` and `consumer`. The
former cycles through coroutines `sim` and `snd`; the latter cycles through
`rcv` and `ana`.
```
producer while sim:
	sim
	snd

consumer while rcv:
	rcv
	ana
```

The script specifies, via the `while`-clause, that `sim` and `rcv` control execution. I.e.,
`producer` group will stop when `sim` stops. `consumer` group stops when `rcv`
does. Notice that for `rcv` to find out that no more data will arrive, `snd`
needs to send it the appropriate message. Accordingly, [send.cpp][] checks whether
`producer` group is stopping by calling `henson_stop()`, and sends the stop
message when this happens.

## Henson Invocation

`henson` accepts the following command-line options. The user can specify on
the command line how many processors to use for each execution group (`-p`) and
variable values to use inside HWL scripts.

```
Usage: ./henson SCRIPT [-p group=SIZE]* [variable=value]*

Execute SCRIPT. procs are the names of execution groups in the script.
Leftover processors get split evenly among the execution groups in the SCRIPT
but not specified in the procs list.

Options:
   -p, --procs SEQUENCE     number of processors to use for a control group [default: ()]
   -l, --log STRING         log level to use [default: info]
   -s, --show-sizes         show group sizes
   -v, --verbose            verbose output
   -t, --show-times         show time spent in each puppet
       --every-iteration    report times at every iteration
   -h, --help               show help
```


## Compiling and Linking

By default, Henson uses [libcoro](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libcoro.html)
to switch contexts between the coroutines; it's included in the source.
Henson optionally depends on [Boost](http://www.boost.org) `>=1.58`,
specifically, the Boost.Context library, which can be used instead of `libcoro`.

You can build Henson library, executable, and examples using CMake:
```
cmake .../path/to/henson
make
```

CMake accepts the following options:

  - `-Duse_boost=on` to switch from `libcoro` to Boost.Context
  - `-Dregenerate-wrapper=on` to regenerate MPI wrappers for the specific implementation you are using (requires Python)
  - `-Dpython=off` to disable building Python bindings
  - `-Dmpi-wrappers=off` to not include MPI wrappers into `libhenson`

When building your own executables, it's important to pass certain flags to the
compiler and to the linker. Compiler needs to prepare position-independent code;
for executables, GCC and Clang need option `-fPIE` to do so.
(In CMake, this option is added automatically when
`CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` is `on`.)

We need to make sure the linker exposes all symbols that `henson` needs. Under
Mac OS X, this seems to happen automatically, but under Linux we need
additional flags. At a minimum we need to add `-pie -Wl,--export-dynamic`.
Sometimes we have to add `-Wl,-u,henson_set_contexts,-u,henson_set_namemap` to
force the linker to export functions even if they are not called within the
executable itself.

In general, getting the linker flags right for the executables is the most
complicated part of using Henson.
